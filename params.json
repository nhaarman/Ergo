{"name":"Ergo","tagline":"A library for easily executing asynchronous tasks using IntentServices","body":"Ergo (Experimental) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nhaarman/Ergo.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nhaarman/Ergo)\r\n===\r\n\r\nErgo is an Android library for easily executing tasks using `IntentServices`.\r\nFeel free to use it all you want in your Android apps provided that you cite this project and include the license in your app.\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n---\r\nOften developers use an `AsyncTask` for executing tasks such as downloading data. Handling state changes can be a real PITA.  \r\nErgo provides a way of executing these tasks using `IntentService`s and `ResultReceiver`s. State changes are handled by storing the `ResultReceiver` (which is bound to the `IntentService`), and binding proper callbacks again.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdd the following to your `build.gradle`:\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\ndependencies {\r\n    compile 'com.nhaarman.ergo:library:0.1.+'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Extend `ErgoService`\r\n  - Implement `createTask(Intent)`\r\n- Extend `ErgoActivity`\r\n  - Implement `onCreateReceivers()`\r\n  - Start your `ErgoService` using `ErgoService.startService(Context, Intent, ResultReceiver)`\r\n\r\nA code example will be available soon.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---\r\n\r\n\tCopyright 2014 Niek Haarman\r\n\r\n\tLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n\tyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n\tYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n\tUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n\tdistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n\tWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n\tSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n\tlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n---\r\n_έργο is Greek for 'task'._\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
